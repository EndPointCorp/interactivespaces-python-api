* Test the rest of the new_ methods in Master
* Test get_ methods with lambda patterns in Master
* Separate .fetch(), _get_absoslute_url() and part of .new() methods from API classes to Communicable to make everything more DRY
* create relaunch script:
** it should have a config file
** it should iterate over live activity groups and perform a "deactivate => status => activate" loop as many times as needed
* get_live_activity_groups() returns 2 objects instead of 3
