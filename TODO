* Test the rest of the new_ methods in Master
* Test get_ methods with lambda patterns in Master
* Separate .fetch(), _get_absoslute_url() and part of .new() methods from API classes to Communicable to make everything more DRY
* get_live_activity_groups() returns 2 objects instead of 3
* make queries more strict e.g. get_controller_name with controller_name=ISCTL will work both for ISCTX and ISCTY which is wrong
* when more than one object is returned for singular methods like .get_space_controller or .get_live_activity, a proper exception should be thrown
* make master.get_live_activity_group() accept "live_activities" list as a param and parse it. Currently it's being ignored.
